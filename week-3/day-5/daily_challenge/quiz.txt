- A class is a definition of an object with a list of properties and methods.
- An instance is a an actual object created from the outline provided by the class.
- Encapsulation is the concept of properties and methods being available only inside of the class/instance they are declared in.
- Abstraction is the concept of simplifying processes by creating functionality that can execute a more complex process just by triggering it through a function call a simpler Abstraction
- Inheritance is where a class is defined as containing all the properties of another class, so that those properties don't need to be individually defined again. 
- Multiple Inheritance is where a class inherits properties from more than one other class, so it contains all properties from both.
- Polymorphism is the concept of modifying the same methods inherited from a class in several different more specific child classes.
- MRO is the rules of overiding methods when inheriting from parent classes. If the method is defined again in the child class then the new functionality replaces the inherited method.
